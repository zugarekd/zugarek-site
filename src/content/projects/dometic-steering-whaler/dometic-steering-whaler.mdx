## Goal

Get a **stable speed source** onto the network so:
- Autopilot behaves correctly
- Helm display has consistent data
- No weird limp-mode behavior caused by missing inputs
- Boston Whaler 130 Super Sport with Simrad GO7 autopilot + Dometic EA1000 + Precision-9

## Setup

**Network:** NMEA 2000 backbone with proper termination, power tee, and drops.

## Devices

### ED1800 — Dometic Optimus EPS Color Display

- Access dealer settings:
  - Hold the **Menu** button for ~3 seconds
  - Enter dealer code: `0906`

## Symptoms

- Limp mode on bench setup

## Root cause (what actually happened)
-CAN 3 RPM data needed

Write what you discovered here.

## Fix

- What you changed (wiring, config, firmware)
- How you validated it (screens, PGNs observed, sea trial)

## Lessons learned

- Keep a known-good spare GPS puck for isolation testing
- Treat backbone power + termination like “layer 1” of the system
- Document PGNs and which device is the authoritative source
