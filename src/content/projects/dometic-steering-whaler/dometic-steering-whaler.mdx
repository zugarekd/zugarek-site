## Overview

This project documents the bench setup and commissioning process for a **Boston Whaler 130 Super Sport** equipped with:

- **Simrad GO7**
- **Dometic Optimus EPS steering**
- **EA1000 autopilot module**
- **Precision-9 heading sensor**
- Full **NMEA 2000 backbone**

The goal was to create a stable, predictable network environment before launching — including simulating engine RPM and water speed to validate autopilot and steering behavior.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Establish a **stable speed and RPM source** on the NMEA 2000 network so that:

- The autopilot behaves correctly
- The helm display shows consistent data
- Steering calibration can be completed
- Limp-mode or fault conditions caused by missing data are eliminated

---

## Network Architecture

A standard NMEA 2000 backbone was used with:

- Proper termination (120Ω at both ends)
- Dedicated power tee
- Individual drop cables per device
- Verified backbone voltage and resistance

Treat backbone power and termination as **Layer 1** — if this isn’t correct, nothing else will behave predictably.

# Devices & Configuration

---

## ED1800 — Dometic Optimus EPS Display

The **ED1800** is the primary helm display for the Optimus EPS system. It provides:

- Steering configuration
- Rudder limit setup
- System diagnostics
- Autopilot integration status
- Real-time network data

### 🔐 Accessing Dealer Settings

To enter advanced configuration:

1. Hold the **Menu** button for ~3 seconds
2. Enter dealer code: `0906`

---

### 🖥 Display Configuration

The display configuration screen controls:

- Units
- Layout
- Displayed data fields
- Behavior settings

---

### ⚙️ Steering Configuration

Dealer mode exposes:

- Steering stop calibration
- Rudder limits
- EPS system diagnostics
- Commissioning tools

---

## 🧭 EA1000 Autopilot Integration

The **EA1000** integrates directly with the Optimus EPS and the NMEA 2000 backbone.

Once configured, it consumes:

- Heading data (Precision-9)
- Speed input
- Engine RPM
- Rudder feedback

# ESP32 NMEA 2000 Simulator

To avoid repeatedly launching the boat for testing, I built an ESP32-based NMEA 2000 message generator.

Repository:

👉 https://github.com/zugarekd/NMEA2000-Sender-Screen

---

## 🔧 What It Simulates

The ESP32 broadcasts:

- **PGN 127488** — Engine Rapid Update (RPM)
- **PGN 128259** — Speed Through Water (STW/SOW)
- Heading and other optional test data

This allows:

- Steering stop calibration
- Autopilot idle detection validation
- RPM display verification
- Network troubleshooting without the engine running

---

## CAN Bus Interface

The ESP32 connects via a CAN transceiver to the NMEA 2000 backbone and acts as a fully compliant node.

---

## 🧭 Bench Validation on Simrad GO7

With the ESP32 connected, the Simrad GO7 correctly displayed:

- Simulated RPM
- Simulated speed over water
- Network status

![Simrad Bench Test](/projects/dometic-steering-whaler/simrad.jpg)

This confirmed the network and display stack were functioning before sea trial.

---

# Troubleshooting Notes

## Symptom

- Limp mode during bench setup
- Steering system refusing calibration

## Root Cause

RPM data was required on the appropriate CAN channel (CAN 3) for the system to recognize the engine as “running” at idle.

Without valid RPM input, the system treated the setup as incomplete.

## Fix

- Ensured correct RPM PGN broadcast
- Verified source address
- Confirmed reception on network
- Validated via display diagnostics

---

# Lessons Learned

- Always keep a known-good spare GPS puck for isolation testing
- Backbone power + termination = foundation of everything
- Know which device is authoritative for each PGN
- Simulating data can dramatically accelerate commissioning
- Bench validation prevents on-water surprises

---

## Closing Thoughts

Modern marine electronics are networked systems. Treat them like distributed software stacks — isolate variables, validate inputs, and control your test environment.

The ESP32 simulator turned what could have been multiple launch/debug cycles into a controlled lab exercise.
