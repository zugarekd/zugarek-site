## Goal

Get a **stable speed source** onto the network so:
- Autopilot behaves correctly
- Helm display has consistent data
- No weird limp-mode behavior caused by missing inputs

## Setup

**Network:** NMEA 2000 backbone with proper termination, power tee, and drops.
**Devices:** autopilot computer + heading sensor + GPS source + display.

## Symptoms

- Speed present intermittently
- Some devices show speed, others don’t
- Calibration screens claim missing sensor

## Root cause (what actually happened)

Write what you discovered here.

## Fix

- What you changed (wiring, config, firmware)
- How you validated it (screens, PGNs observed, sea trial)

## Lessons learned

- Keep a known-good spare GPS puck for isolation testing
- Treat backbone power + termination like “layer 1” of the system
- Document PGNs and which device is the authoritative source
